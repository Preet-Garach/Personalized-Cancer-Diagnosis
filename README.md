# Personalized-Cancer-Diagnosis-
End to end ML project. In this project EDA, feature engineering, stability of feature in dataset as well as the importance w.r.t the prediction of class is determined. One hot encoding as well as Response Coding is done so as to gain more accuracy for model. Multiple Models are run with hyperparameter tuning to understand the confusion matrix and log-loss of the models. Miss classification error is also calculated as to determine the best model for this problem.
